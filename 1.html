        Natures archive comprises all the content published since the journal’s
        launch in 1869; it includes some images, articles and language that by
        twenty-first-century standards are offensive and harmful, including
        sexist, racist and other discriminatory content. This content does not
        represent Nature’s current values and would be unacceptable to publish
        today. We have not sought to suppress it because it is part of the
        scientific and historical record, and so should remain available for
        scholars now and in the future. Nature is committed to making the
        changes necessary to ensure that it learns from its past and creates a
        publication that champions science for everyone.Brothers Alexander and
        Daniel Macmillan founded their bookshop and publishing house in
        Cambridge, UK, in 1843. After Daniel’s death in 1857, Alexander opened a
        London branch at 23 Henrietta Street, Covent Garden. Macmillan’s
        headquarters were in Cambridge until 1863, when they moved to 16 Bedford
        Street in London. The academic standing of the Macmillans in Cambridge
        (their shop was at the heart of the university city) later helped
        Alexander to establish contacts with eminent men of science in London.
        He would host ‘tobacco parliaments’, at which science, art and hot
        topics of the day, such as Darwinism, would be discussed. This “talk,
        tobacco and tipple on Thursdays” group, as he described it, fostered
        friendships among the great scientific educators of the Victorian era,
        including Huxley and the physicist John Tyndall, who were eager to write
        for Macmillan. In 1859, Alexander launched Macmillan’s Magazine, the
        first shilling monthly in England, aiming to unify science, literature
        and the arts under one banner, with David Masson as the editor. Huxley’s
        article ‘Time & Life’ was published in the second issue.
